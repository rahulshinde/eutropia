I started with a series of photos by <a href="http://www.nicolasdamiens.com/project/tokyo-no-ads/">Nicolas Damiens</a> in which he had removed all advertisments from photos he had taken in tokyo. After completing the three b & w compositions, I realized that it would make sense to try and simulate the effects of augmented reality into a larger working space.
