				The first application was a calendar of events (in the form of a poster). Initially I had the idea of integrating augmented reality to deliver what would normally be printed infromation. The goal was to retain the identities symbolic nature as it had developed through my experimentation. After two unsuccesful attempts, primarily due to the limitation of the <a target="blank" href="http://www.augmentedev.com/">app</a> I was using, I settled on a print piece simulating the effects.
